# Customer-Segments-Analysis-with-unsupervised-ML
Udacity "Data Scientist" ND Project with the usage of unsupervised ML

# Project overview
This project uses techniques from unsupervised ML (PCA & kMeans) to investigate two datasets. First one contains anonymized  information of 800'000 Germans. The second contains the same set of information of 120'000 clients of mail-sales company. Task is to investigate how the population groups identified from first dataset are represented in the second one. From this one can learn which population groups are likely to be the customers of the mail-sales company.
